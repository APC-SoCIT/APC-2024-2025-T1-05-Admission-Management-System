                The Sunrays stands for the light that illuminates your path in building a temple of immortal souls in the
                future generations; the Open Book means that anyone may come to engraft a branch of knowledge into the
                stock of wisdom. The Mountains and Sunrays represents hope of a new beginning. The Gear symbolizes
                technology and know-how in the modern society. The Building represents the City of Taguig of modern
                infrastructures whilst the White Duck represents Pateros. The Laurel leaves represent the dignity of man
                and serve as the emblem of victory, of a courageous flight of success. This is the meaning of our seal, revere
                it, cherish it, and lives by it always.
